**Overview**

Implementation of the processor-internal data memory is enabled by the processor's `MEM_INT_DMEM_EN`
generic. The total memory size in bytes is defined via the `MEM_INT_DMEM_SIZE` generic. Note that this
size should be a power of two to optimize physical implementation. If the DMEM is implemented,
it is mapped to base address `0x80000000` by default (see section <<_address_space>>).
The DMEM is always implemented as true RAM.

.Platform-Specific Memory Primitives
[NOTE]
If required, the default DMEM can be replaced by a platform-/technology-specific primitive to
optimize area utilization, timing and power consumption.

.Memory Size
[NOTE]
If the configured memory size (via the `MEM_INT_DMEM_SIZE` generic) is not a power of two the actual memory
size will be auto-adjusted to the next power of two (e.g. configuring a memory size of 60kB will result in a
physical memory size of 64kB).

.Legacy HDL Style
[TIP]
If synthesis fails to infer block RAM for the DMEM, turn on the `alternaitve_style_en_c` option inside
the memory's VHDL source file. When enabled, a different HDL style is used to describe the memory core.

.Execute from RAM
[TIP]
The CPU is capable of executing code also from arbitrary data memory.
